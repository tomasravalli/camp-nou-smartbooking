## Introduction
With a capacity of 99,354, Camp Nou is the biggest stadium in Europe. The Club has about 90,000 members who own a stadium seat for the entire season and who on many occasions do not attend matches. For this reason, the Club has created an official secondary market, called Seient Lliure, as a platform for these members to 'release' their seat and recover 50% of its value.

## Context
Currently 37% of the seats for matches at the Camp Nou are released in the last 72 hours before the match. Therefore there is a short timespan to sell the entire stock of seats that are finally available.
The consequences are:
- As there are hardly any releases by members at the time a match goes on sale, for many matches there are hardly any tickets available. Additionally, it is very difficult to have seats available in pairs, making sales difficult.
- Match after match there are many free and unsold seats left, showing an inconsistency between the real demand to attend a Camp Nou match and the final attendance reflected in the stands.
- On several occasions there had not been seats available until 2-3 days before.
